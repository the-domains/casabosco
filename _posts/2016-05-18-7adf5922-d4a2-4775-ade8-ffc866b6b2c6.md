The beginning:

My name is Martha, Bosco's mom and Alex wife. We live in Buenos Aires in a very nice apartment in Palermo Chico. Bosco was born on august 2014 and about three months later when he started moving around the house we were wondering about buying a new apartment with more space. One day I was browsing around the web and fund about a place called Nordelta. I heard about it before but never been there anyway there was a very nice lot with a fair price, so i told Alex and we decided to visit the place with a realtor. Our first impression was great, everything is nice and the way we like things to be done. The first lot we visited was on la Isla one of the private neighborhoods inside Nordelta and was the lot we bought after seeing so many in different neighborhoods. So on December 2014 we made the offer and on jaguar 2015 we bought it! We are really exited about our lot, neighborhood and building our family home in Buenos Aires.
