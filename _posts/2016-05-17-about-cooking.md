About cooking

What would be the best way to cook?

Well to answer this I researched what do professional cooks do and what I found was interesting. They use a special oven called a convection.

Regular ovens usually have 2 heating elements so they cook the food unevenly. On the contrary convection ovens have multiple elements and convections fans that move the air around in order to achieve a more even cooking. The air movement provides some additional benefits too, like requiring less time to cook (vital when serving customers by the minute) and less energy

The most advanced ovens are the convection steam ovens. Where you can control temperature, airflow and moisture. Steaming can help you retain more nutrients (up to 22% more vitamins are retained in vegetables, for instance).

Ok so we need a convection oven, but what about the Cooktop? Should we use a gas cooktop? Should we use an electric cooktop? Or an induction cooktop?

Ok let's list pros and cons of each

Gas cooktop

Pros: 30% less time to reach boiling point

Cons: Requires gas infrastructure, the flame releases grease and water vapor to the kitchen so it requires proper ventilation, it is difficult to clean and has low efficiency (6% efficiency)

Electric cooktop (Teflon plates)

Pros: Good efficiency (51% efficiency), easy to clean, stays hot after turned off, does not burn oxygen, healthier.

Cons: Requires special electric installation (because it uses more than 7kW it requires its own thermic resistance), once its turned off you can't see that the plates are hot and they can burn you, it requires more heating time.

Induction Cooktop (Vitroceramic)

Pros: Best efficiency (56% efficiency), extremely easy to clean, nice aesthetics, does not burn oxygen, healthier.

Cons: Requires special electric installation (because it uses more than 7kW it requires its own thermic resistance), it requires more heating time.

So let's dig deeper into the energy requirements. Labs tests show the following

Gas: 1.800 Kcal (2.09 Kw/h)

Electric plates: 211 Kcal (0.245 Kw/h)

Vitroceramic induction: 192.5 Kcal (0.224 Kw/h)

Meaning electric plates requires 88% less energy than gas, and vitroceramic induction 89% less energy than gas.

So we are going to use a vitroceramic induction cooktop because it is more efficient and it is safer for us and the environment. If a kid touches the cooktop he wont get burnt since it doesn't have residual heat as the other two options. Plus, since we are not burning anything we avoid releasing carbon monoxide and we reduce the risk of fires.

The oven is also going to be electric. Why?

It uses less energy, because it more hermetic and does not loose residual heat.

It does not produce combustion, making it healthier and less prone to accidents.

Healthier food because it does not use combustion

Faster because of the convection

It is possible to cook 3 different dishes simultaneously, without mixing smells or tastes.

The different cooking programs adjust the temperature and convection accordingly to achieve the best results

Digging deeper into the energy requirements it takes 2.613 Kcal (3.03 Kw/h) for a gas oven to cook a 1.5Kg chicken and only 1.920 Kcal (1.27Kw/h) for the electric one to do the same job, meaning the electric oven is 58% more efficient.

So we are getting an electric convection oven and an electric induction cooktop. This means we won't need a gas installation and the money that we save in that which is significant can go to better appliances and sink, faucets, etc... that in turn would help us save more money and energy.

Some tips

Make sure you do an initial cleaning if you need it. Some ovens come with a special coating to protect them in the fabrication process. Read the manual of your oven to make sure you need one and how to do it.

Try to buy an oven with tangential ventilation. When the oven is turned on a fan helps you keep the oven and the circundating furniture refrigerated.

Appliance are rated by their energy efficiency. Make sure you buy class A that is the best class.
