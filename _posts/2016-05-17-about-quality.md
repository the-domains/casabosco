About quality

We always look for quality in every aspect of our life, so when we decided to build a house we immediately knew we wanted it to be of the highest quality.

Some people associate higher quality with higher costs, but that is wrong. They say that to be fair one must at least agree that there are higher upfront costs to quality, but that is lying to oneself and that is even worse than being wrong.

It's like paying for a house with a credit card that charges 24% annual interest and saying you paid less for your house because you only paid a fraction upfront. You are paying more, believe me, you are paying a lot more.

Needless to say, not factoring the overall lifecycle of the house it's a big mistake, since its operating costs can be humongous depending on the location. The funny thing is that some people also tend to forget that the asset has intrinsic value in itself and that this value is more likely to be retained if the house was built with higher quality.

So I think it is pretty clear that we want a house of the highest quality. But what does quality mean when you are building a house?

Well it happens that there is a lot of knowledge about it these days so I'll keep it simple and tell you that it's all about comfort and wellbeing. We can further divide the topic of comfort into 5 sections that I'll expand in further posts.

Acoustic comfort

Visual comfort

Indoor air quality

Quality of drinking water

Thermal comfort

Also to consider are the psychological aspects of comfort and wellbeing, but I'll just focus on

Aesthetics

Functions

Connection to the environment
